THE VISION OF DEAR DIARY

The vision of Dear Diary is to showcase places we, as adventurers and explorers have been to and to share our experiences within those places with other likeminded people. From culture and food, through to the people and their different ways of life to our own. Hopefully by the end of your visit with us you will have experienced a wide variety of environments. Be it from the cold, wet streets of Dublin, Ireland to the dry, dusty ancient alleys of Kathmandu, Nepal. We want to hear your thoughts, feelings, experiences and adventures you got up to on your travels.
